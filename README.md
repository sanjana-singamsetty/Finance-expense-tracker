### **Week -1  Highlights**  
1. **OCR Code Implementation**  
   - **Presented By**: Shanmukh  
   - Shanmukh shared an OCR code for extracting and processing financial data from bank statements in PDF format.  
   - The OCR process involves:
     - Extracting transaction details.
     - Cleaning and organizing the data.
     - Classifying transactions as credits or debits.  

2. **Proposed MERN Workflow**  
   - **Frontend (React)**:  
     - Users upload bank statements via a user-friendly interface.  
   - **Backend (Node.js)**:  
     - The uploaded PDF is sent to the Node.js server, which handles the file transfer and forwards it to the Python-based service.  
   - **Processing Service (Flask)**:  
     - Flask processes the PDF using the OCR code, extracts relevant transaction details, and returns structured data.  
   - **Frontend Display**:  
     - Processed data is displayed in a table format for the user, showing key transaction details (Date, Amount, Particulars, Credit/Debit).
